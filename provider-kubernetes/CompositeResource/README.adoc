== Compositions and Composite Resources
Compositions and CompositeResources allow us to mix and match multiple external resources.

Learning goals:

* The Magic Triangle between `CompositeResourceDefinition`, `Composition` and `Claim`
** Understanding this is half the game!
* Why Events are important
* How to configure `Compositions` from `Claims`
* How `Composites` find their `Composition` (a bit)
* How to organize Patches

== Preparation
Move to the lessons directory

[source,shell]
----
cd provider-kubernetes/CompositeResource
----

Start some watches
[source,shell]
----
watch -n 1 kubectl get crds,xrds
----

== CompositeResourceDefinition (XRD)
Let's create our first XRD

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f CompositeResourceDefinition.yaml
----

* A CRD was created
* The XRD is Established

Let's peek inside

[source,shell]
----
kubectl describe crd xmyfirstcompositeresources.acme.example.org | less
----

* Crossplane adds a lot of stuff
* Some of it we'll discuss later

== Claims: Offer an XR
To offer a CompositeResource we need Crossplane to generate a Claim

Uncomment the Lines after `claimNames` and apply

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f CompositeResourceDefinition.yaml
----


* A second CRD was created
* The XRD is now offered

== Claims
Let's create a Claim and see what happens

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f Claim.yaml
----

* The Claim is not Ready

Let's find out why!

[source,shell]
----
kubectl describe claim first-example-claim | less
----

* If something goes wrong, an Event is emitted
* It's waiting for the `CompositeResource` to become ready

== Claims
Then let's have a look at the CompositeResource

[source,shell]
----
kubectl describe composite | more
----

* No compatible Composition found

== Compositions
So, let's create a Composition! A simple one, containing a Deployment and a Service

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f Composition.yaml
kubectl get deployments,services
kubectl get crossplane
----

* The Claim becomes ready!
* There is a Service and a Deployment! Success!
* There are new Objects!
** `ProviderConfigUsages` prevent a `ProviderConfig` from being deleted while in use
** `objects.kubernetes.crossplane.io/v1alpha1` are the ManagedResources

== Compositions
Let's filter all results for the Objects belonging to our Claim

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get crossplane,composite -l 'crossplane.io/claim-name=first-example-claim'
----

* `ProviderConfigUsages` are not labeled with the `claim-name`
* Does anybody know why we have to specify the `composite`? It is in the Category `crossplane`

== Using Claims to Configure Resources
Kill the old watches and start new watches

[source,shell]
----
watch -n 1 kubectl get deployments,pods,services,claim,managed
----

Four Replicas is way too much! Let's make it two

[source,shell]
----
kubectl patch claim first-example-claim --type merge -p '{"spec":{"replicas": 2}}'
----

* Two Pods vanish. Success!

== Let's Make It Double
Let's create another Claim and see what happens

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f Claim-2.yaml
----

* A second Claim, Synced and Ready
* New MRs, Synced and Ready
* But ... no second deployment?

== Fun with Claims
Let's see what happens when we change one of the claims:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl patch claim first-example-claim --type merge -p '{"spec":{"replicas": 4}}'
----

* Both "truths" are applied ad nauseam
* I've seen this on AWS Resource
** The first Resource defines Tags (for a SecurityGroup)
** A separate Tag resource adds a Tag
** The SecurityGroup Controller removes the Tag
** The Claim never became Ready

== Using claim-name and claim-namespace
Let's fix this by using different names

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f CompositionWithPatching.yaml
----

* The new names are applied
* The old resources stay behind?

Let's clean up the leftovers
[source,shell]
----
kubectl delete deployment my-deployment
kubectl delete service my-service
----

== Rolling out Changes
We can change all `XRs` by changing the `Composition`.

Let's change the service Port to 8081

[source,shell]
----
kubectl edit composition xmyfirstcomposition.acme.example.org
----

* Both services now use 8081

== Opting out of Updates
We can opt out of updates by changing the `compositionUpdatePolicy` to `Manual` and the Service Port back to 8080

[source,shell]
----
kubectl patch claim first-example-claim --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"compositionUpdatePolicy": "Manual"}}'
kubectl edit composition xmyfirstcomposition.acme.example.org
----

* Only the second `Service` changed

== Manually Update Composition via Claim
We can update the `compositionRef` manually

First we list the `CompositionRevisions`, then we use the name of the newest `CompositionRevision`

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get compositionrevisions
kubectl patch claim first-example-claim --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"compositionRevisionRef":{"name":"xmyfirstcomposition.acme.example.org-5b0265f"}}}'
kubectl get claim,composite -o=custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,REF:.spec.compositionRevisionRef.name'
----

* The first `Service` still uses port 8081
* There seems to be a bug - the `compositionRevisionRef` is not transferred from the `Claim` to the `XR`

== Manually Update Composition via Composite
So, let's see if we can fix it by updating the `XR`

[source,shell]
----
kubectl patch composite my-first-composite-resource-claim-lmmbd --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"compositionRevisionRef":{"name":"xmyfirstcomposition.acme.example.org-5b0265f"}}}'
----

* Success!

== Cleanup
Let's get rid of all the stuff we created

[source,shell]
----
kubectl delete xrd xmyfirstcompositeresources.acme.example.org
----

* That was easy :)
* And scary ðŸ˜±
